                slightly smaller peak on either side of it. Traders look at head and Shoulder pattern to predict
                <b>Bullish</b> to <b>Bearish Reversal.</b> Typically, the first and third peak will be smaller than
                second , but they will all fall back to the same level of support known as the "Neckline".Onece the
                third peak has fallen back to the level os support .It is likely that it will breakout into a Bearish
                Downtrend.

                cup and handle where the cup is in the shape of a “U” and the handle has a slight downward drift.

                The cup appears similar to a rounding bottom chart pattern, and the handle is similar to a wedge
                pattern.

                The right-hand side of the pattern has low trading volume that may be as short as seven weeks or as long

                which are formed by joining two trend lines which converge. It can be a rising wedge or a falling wedge.

                Rising wedge occurs when the price of the stock is rising over a time whereas falling wedge occurs when
                the price of the stock is falling over a time.

                Wedge pattern can be drawn by using trend lines and connecting the peaks and the troughs.

                Once there is price breakout, there is a sharp movement of prices in either of the directions </p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-samll">A pennant pattern or a flag pattern is created when there is a sharp
                movement in the stock either upward or downward.

                This is followed by a period of consolidation that creates the pennant shape because of the converging
                lines.

                Then a breakout movement occurs in the same direction as the big stock move. Pennants patterns are
                similar to flag patterns and tend to last between one and three weeks.

                At the initial stock movement there is a significant volume which is followed by weaker volume in the
                pennant section, and then rise in the volume at the breakout. </p>

                Sometimes it can be also created at the end of a downward trend as a reversal pattern, but it more
